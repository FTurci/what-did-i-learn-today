# Bob's note on surface tension $\times$ compressibility

See attachment for the  notes. Here follow some points.


## Physical ingredients

It would seem that the following are the main assumptions for $\sigma \chi \sim const$


- the square-gradient approximation with double quartic is valid, leading to eq. 85 of Parry , which only contains the density difference between teh two phases and the gas and liquid correlation lengths.
- the gas coexistence density is assumed to be small compared to the liquid so that $(\delta \rho)\sim \rho_l^2$ . This simplifies the density dependence of $\chi$
- the ratio between correlation length is assumed to be about 0.5 (but any constant would probably be fine)
