# Persistent homology

Persistent homology is a method to identify spatial features in data that are robust at different levels of resolutions. 

It consists in continuously varying a resolution scale to identify birth and death scales of the features and to rank them according to the largest persistence span. 

An exmaple applied to peak detection is provided by https://github.com/erdogant/findpeaks
